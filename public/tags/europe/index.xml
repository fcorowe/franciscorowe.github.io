      <title>Understanding and Predicting the Long-term Labour Market and Migration Trajectories of Immigrants and Their Children in the United Kingdom</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior empirical research has advanced our understanding of immigrants’ assimilation, their descendants and the role of ethnic concentration. Yet work has remained cross-sectional in nature, focusing on the occupational outcomes and residential locations at a specific point in time. Little progress has been made to understand the trajectories of immigrants and their children over a long period of time. Understanding of the long-term trajectories of immigrants and their children is key to assess their prospects for economic and social success, and develop effective policy interventions to assist their integration process, unleash their skills’ potential and facilitate upward social mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Understanding the declining trend in internal migration in Europe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Internal migration is of fundamental importance for individuals and families to achieve their goals and aspirations. At a societal level, internal migration underpins the effective functioning of the labour and housing markets. It is essential to economic resilience by bringing knowledge, skills and labour to locations where needed to enhance economic productivity (Blanchard et al. 1992). This is particular relevant today. Internal migration rates have continuously declined over the last five decades in most countries around the world. This decline is likely to have wide-ranging implications for the functioning of the economy and individuals’ aspirations, but remains poorly recognised and understood. National and local governments have been concerned that the decline in migration heralds a less flexible economy where workers do not move to regions with jobs (Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl 2012). Internal migration is the main driver of changing settlement patterns within countries, so understanding declining migration levels is critical to plan for infrastructure delivery and forecast housing needs to ensure appropriate evidence-based policy responses. The project aims to establish the start and pace of the migration decline in 18 European countries, and to determine the factors underpinning this trend by examining associations between the drop in migration rates and broader demographic and socio-economic changes in the last three decades.&lt;/p&gt;

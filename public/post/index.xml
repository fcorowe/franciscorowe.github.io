&lt;div id=&#34;r-markdown&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;R Markdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post introduces our recently published R package, CIM, to measure the impacts of migration on local population structures. We developed the methodology in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/00324728.2017.1416155&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. This paper is one of the 10 top ten most viewed articles in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/action/showMostReadArticles?journalCode=rpst20&#34;&gt;Population Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;installing&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&amp;quot;CIM&amp;quot;)
library(CIM)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This package enables quantifying the impact of internal migration on age, gender, educational population structures and inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;example&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I provide a short example of how this can be used to measure the impact of internal migration on residential age segregation in the Greater London Metropolitan Area, England, drawing on one-year migration data by age bands (i.e. 1-14, 15-29, 30-34, 45-64 and 65+) at the local authority level, 2011 UK Censuses. Local authorities comprising outside the Greater London Metropolitan Area are collapsed into a single area, labelled “the Rest of the UK”. I use the same approach employed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321998653_The_Changing_Impacts_of_Internal_Migration_on_Residential_Socio-Economic_Segregation_in_the_Greater_Santiago&#34;&gt;Rodríguez-Vignoli and Rowe (2017)&lt;/a&gt; to measure the impact of internal migration on residential educational segregation in the Greater Santiago, Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;computation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Computation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute and print the CIM outputs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  CIM.duncan &amp;lt;- CIM(pop65over, pop1_14, pop15_29, pop30_44, pop45_64, calculation = &amp;quot;duncan&amp;quot;, numerator = 1, DuncanAll= TRUE)
  CIM.duncan$duncan_index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;interpretation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CIM for the Duncan index of dissimilarity indicates that internal migration has contributed to increase age segregation of the population aged 65 and over in the Greater London Metropolitan Area by 2.81% between 2010 and 2011 i.e. from 16.2% in 2010 to 19% in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;visualisation&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visualisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualise where the population aged 65 and over in the Greater London Metropolitan Area is concentrating, we can map differences in the spatial distribution of this population across local authority districts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First install and load the needed packages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(c(&amp;quot;rgdal&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dplyr&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tmap&amp;quot;))
library(rgdal)
library(dplyr)
library(tmap)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: Download a shapefile containing the Greater London Local Authority Districts from the shapefile folder from this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fcorowe/cim&#34;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The Local Authority Districts for the City of London and Westminster in our shapefile are combined to make our shapefile consistent with our migration data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the shapefile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Greater_London &amp;lt;- readOGR(dsn = &amp;quot;.&amp;quot;, layer = &amp;quot;Greater_London_districts&amp;quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plot the shapefile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  plot(Greater_London)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtain the differences in the spatial distribution of the population aged 65 and over across local authority districts using the CIM.Duncan function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  CIM.duncan &amp;lt;- CIM(pop65over, pop1_14, pop15_29, pop30_44, pop45_64, calculation = &amp;quot;duncan&amp;quot;, numerator = 1, DuncanAll= TRUE)
  Dun_65over &amp;lt;- CIM.duncan$duncan_results&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualise the results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  head(Dun_65over)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Append these data to the shapefile using the local authority names as joiner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Duncan_65p &amp;lt;- merge(Greater_London, Dun_65over, by.x = &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;, by.y = 0)
  head(Duncan_65p@data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set to a static map view and create a map using tmap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  tmap_mode(&amp;#39;plot&amp;#39;)
  tm_shape(Duncan_65p) +
  tm_polygons(&amp;quot;ASShareFV_diff&amp;quot;, style=&amp;quot;quantile&amp;quot;,border.alpha = 0.1, palette = &amp;quot;YlOrRd&amp;quot;, 
             title=&amp;quot;ASShareFV_diff&amp;quot;)+
  tm_compass(position = c(&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;)) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = c(&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, even better we can create an interactive map! by setting an interactive map view&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  tmap_mode(&amp;#39;view&amp;#39;)
  tm_shape(Duncan_65p) +
  tm_polygons(&amp;quot;ASShareFV_diff&amp;quot;, style=&amp;quot;quantile&amp;quot;,border.alpha = 0.1, palette = &amp;quot;YlOrRd&amp;quot;, 
               title=&amp;quot;ASShareFV_diff&amp;quot;)+
  tm_compass(position = c(&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;)) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = c(&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Migration of Young Human Capital?</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-the-migration-of-young-educated-people-important&#34;&gt;Why is the migration of young educated people important?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human capital is a key ingredient of economic development and productivity. Regions attracting educated individuals experience economic growth and enjoy high-status of social wellbeing, while areas affected by net migration losses of human capital struggle to sustain a vibrant local economy. Young educated individuals are highly mobile and comprise a important component of the workforce. Spatial mobility of young educated individuals generates differentiated outcomes across the urban hierarchy. Rural areas tend to lose young population, creating pressures to attract and retain young educated individuals to help redress accelerating ageing populations and replenishing labour gaps. By contrast, larger metropolitan areas operate as magnets enticing the ‘best’ and the ‘brightest’ spurring local economic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-new-and-are-our-aims&#34;&gt;What is new and are our aims?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recently published Special Issue, we draw on a select group of international leading experts in human capital mobility from a variety of countries, including Australia, China, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, the USA and Sweden – and seek to address key outstanding issues associated with the spatial mobility of young educated people. In particular, we we draw on longitudinal data sets so that we can begin to examine longer windows of time and better capture mobility sequences over the transition from school through university to the labour market and how they intersect with their educational and occupational pathways and impacts on places. We argue that understanding these trajectories will augment our capacity to guide regional development policy on the attraction and retention of human capital and develop more appropriate policy strategies to address skill shortages, particularly in rural areas, and enhance individual employment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How do we define functional labour market areas?</title>
      <link>/post/llma_post/</link>

&lt;p&gt;We all know that spatial analyses based on administrative boundaries to understand labour market activity are questionable, because of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) and measurement issues, leading to spurious causal relationships, misguided policy recommendations and complex model specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, there has been a growing literature concerning the delimitation of Functional Labour Market Areas (FLMAs). They are empirically delimited based on commuting (travel-to-work) flow data between Basic Territorial Units (BTUs; eg. communes, municipalities or counties), which are often the finest level of geography at which data are available. The trick here is that there are two conflicting objectives. On the one hand, we want to create FMLAs that are composed of BTUs with strong commuting links i.e. strong cohesion or inner integration. On the other, we want FLMAs comprised of BTUs with weak or no commuting links with other FLMAs i.e. higher self-containment or external perfection. Large FLMAs lead to higher overall levels of self-containment but lower levels of cohesion from a certain threshold. Finding an appropriate balance between self-containment and cohesion is thus critical and challenging task for FMLAs delineation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have recently published a paper (Casado-Díaz, Martínez-Bernabéu and Rowe 2017) on a novel methodology based on evolutionary computational algorithms to delineate FLMAs for Chile. Why Chile? Because we wanted to try out this new methodology on a unusual geography and Chile provides just that; and, because I am Chilean! We compared the performance of our approach to the most widely used methodology for official LMA delimitation, the travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) method, in terms of computational efficiency. We also compared the suitability of the resulting FLMAs against administrative areas and TTWAs based on expert local knowledge and misallocation of BTUs. Normally BTUs are allocated to FLMAs with which they have weak links and need to be reassign to a different FLMA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying our algorithm, we proposed a set of 62 FLMAs, which we called “GEA-LMA”: Grouping Evolutionary Algorithm-Labour Market Areas. The figure below presents these areas against provinces (second administrative level of geography in Chile) and TTWA-LMAs. Overall, the proposed areas outperformed administrative areas and TTWA-LMAs, in terms of self-containment and computing efficiency, providing a more appropriate framework for the analysis of spatial labour market activity. In the paper, we suggested two methodological improvements in order to: (1) produce a better conciliation between the different objectives of regionalization; (2) improve the local quality of the final regionalization by reducing the number of misallocated BTUs and the need to make adjustments to achieve a definitive regionalization; and, (3) increase the efficiency of the evolutionary algorithm by reducing the computational time required to find the optimal regionalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 1. Maps of local self-containment: provinces, TTWA-LMAs and GEA-LMAs (labels for regional capital cities are displayed).
Note: Local self-containment of an area is calculated as the minimum value of the share of residents of a BTU working within its considered region, and the share of jobs of that BTU occupied by its residents.&lt;/p&gt;
